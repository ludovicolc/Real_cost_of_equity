# Problem statement
Investors often face challenges when attempting to calculate the cost of equity for their investment portfolios. One of the main difficulties is determining the appropriate equity risk premium to use, which can have a significant impact on the calculated cost of equity. This process can be time-consuming and complicated, requiring investors to conduct extensive research and analysis of market data. As a result, there is a need for a more streamlined and automated solution that can accurately calculate the cost of equity based on reliable data sources, such as the S&P 500.

# Project's summary
The web application aims to solve the problem faced by investors when calculating the cost of equity. By leveraging S&P 500 data, the tool automatically calculates the current cost of equity and implied equity risk premium, providing users with reliable and accurate results. Additionally, the tool also offers the historical cost of equity, allowing users to analyze trends and make informed investment decisions. 
The web application uses the methodology outlined by Marc H. Goedhart, Timothy M. Koller, and Zane D. Williams of McKinsey & Company to calculate the implied cost of equity. If you would like to learn more about the methodology and data sources used in this project, please follow the link provided.
